# What is ChipTune City?
<hr>
ChipTune City is an indie game inspired by Celeste and Geometry Dash, and created as a response to soulless corporations attempting to milk the most money possible out of every player using heinous anti-consumer tactics such as paywalling content that should reasonably be expected to come with the base game.
It is also meant to be a game for everyone, as the developers have grown from children unable to afford expensive games they see others playing. For children, adults, and everyone else in that situation, this game exists.
